week-8
======

Let’s do some sample work to get a good handle to timers and canvas.

Requirements:
1.	Use a timer to run a function that will fade in and out a div.
	

2.	Show an alert message after a user has been on the page for 10 seconds.
3.	Create some images on a canvas object.
4.	See if you can animate some of those images to move across the canvas.
  a.	Rectangle
  b.	Circle
  c.	A small icon image (16x16)
5.	Use week 4’s assignment to get the first 100 cords of your mouse movements.  Get the cursor image and move it in those cords using timers.
